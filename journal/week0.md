### Create an Admin User

### Installed AWS CLI

**On macOS** (I am installing aws cli locally as I want to try out things locally.)

Ran into issue related to `python3` 

Error Msg: `env: python: No such file or directory` 

Fixed it by running 

```
sudo /usr/bin/python3 awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws
```
